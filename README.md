# QR_image_renamer
Code to rename a folder of images according to the content of a QR code in each image. 
This release has been updated to include a GUI for generating QR codes in bulk from CSV (originally at https://github.com/markwhittyunsw/GenerateQRCode), processing images to extract QR codes, checking the processed images against the generated list and renaming the images. These stages can be carried out independently where possible. 

An evaluation module for testing the performance of QR codes is available at https://github.com/markwhittyunsw/EvaluateQRReaderPaper.

## To run: 
1. Download the barcode-QRcodeScannerPy_20211215.zip file from the 'dist' folder above and unzip the .exe file
2. Run the .exe as "barcode-QRcodeScannerPy_v14.exe" 

## To compile from source
HINT: Use Terminal in PyCharm to run commands for installing packages using pip (not Python Console)
 - install python 3.7.2 64 bit edition
 - update pip: "python -m pip install --upgrade pip" from location of Python installation using Administrator privileged CMD shell.
 - pip install pyzbar
 - pip install numpy
 - pip install opencv-contrib-python
 - run barcode-QRcodeScannerPy.py to install OpenCV (cv2)
 - pip install pyinstaller [Only needed to generate an exe]
 - python barcode-QRcodeScannerPy_v14

## Using pyinstaller to generate an exe
https://medium.com/dreamcatcher-its-blog/making-an-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-script-using-pyinstaller-d1df9170e263
pip install pyinstaller

20190326 Fixing bug in pyzbar when trying to use pyinstaller. 
https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/pyzbar/issues/27
Specifically 
  1) Generate the <project_name>.spec file by trying to run pyinstaller (it may fail or work, or the exe may give an error relating to not being able to find a module names libiconv.dll or libzbar-64.dll)
  2) Edit the .spec file generated by pyinstaller to include the following lines:
```
from pathlib import Path
    from pyzbar import pyzbar
    ...
    # dylibs not detected because they are loaded by ctypes
    a.binaries += TOC([
        (Path(dep._name).name, dep._name, 'BINARY')
        for dep in pyzbar.EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES
    ])
```
3) Rerun pyinstaller with the .spec file as an argument instead of the .py file
4) The .exe works! Otherwise put libiconv.dll in the same folder as the dll.

Notice if jpg is created, this might need additional lines in .spec as the github link above shows.

## Progress
 - [x] Make report on QR code error rates and usage
 - [-] What if no QR code? Filename renamed (prefix underscore). Deprecated feature. Image now ignored.
 - [x] Duplicate QR codes?  Check if name already exists, add incrementing suffix until name is unique
 - [x] Remove strange characters from QR code which could make an invalid filename and replaces them with underscores
 - [x] What if 2 QR codes in one image - only handle the first
 - [x] Generate statistics on images processed. Basic stats are in the GUI.
 - [x] Generate file showing input image list and output file names 
 - [x] Make code distributable (pyinstaller)
 - [x] Given the list of generated QR codes and processed set of codes should have same filenames, can have a tool to compare them and identify duplicates and missing items.
 - [x] Plan paper around the use of these codes - see above
 - [ ] Encode scale into the QR code, so its distance from the reader is known (assume printed correctly)
 - [ ] Add website detailing the project and a fixed QR code which points to it, automatically generated on the cover of each document.
 - [ ] Q: How to make into a Python module?
 - [ ] Q: How to make into a Jupyter notebook? And import the module.
